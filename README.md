## Contribution

- **How to contribute:** Fork the repository, create a branch named `feature/<short-desc>` or `fix/<short-desc>`, implement your changes, and open a Pull Request against `main`.
- **Pull request checklist:** Describe the change, link any related issue, include tests where appropriate, and ensure linting/formatting passes (`npm run lint` / `npm run format` if available).
- **Commit messages:** Use conventional-style prefixes (e.g. `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`) and write a short, descriptive message.
- **Code style & tests:** Follow the existing code style. Run the project's linters and test suite before submitting.
- **Review process:** Maintainers will review PRs, request changes if needed, and merge after approvals. Be responsive to review feedback.
- **Security & sensitive data:** Do not include secrets, API keys, or personal data in issues or PRs. For security vulnerabilities, contact the maintainers privately.

## Feature Requests

- **How to request a feature:** Please open a new GitHub issue and add the `enhancement` label (or select the "Feature Request" template if available).
- **Required information:**
  - **Summary:** One-line title for the request.
  - **Motivation / Use case:** Why this feature is needed and who benefits.
  - **Proposed solution (optional):** A suggested approach or design.
  - **Alternatives considered:** Any other options you evaluated.
  - **Screenshots / mockups:** Visuals or sketches, if helpful.
  - **Priority / impact:** How urgent or impactful this is.
  - **Environment:** OS, Node/npm versions, and app version if relevant.
- **What happens next:** Maintainers will triage new feature requests, ask for clarification if needed, and label/prioritize them. If you'd like to implement the feature, comment on the issue to let maintainers know (and link your PR to the issue with `Closes #<issue>`).
- **Acceptance criteria:** Clear, testable criteria and small incremental steps increase the chance of quick approval.
